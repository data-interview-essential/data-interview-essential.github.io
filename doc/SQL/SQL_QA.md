1. `PARTITION BY` and `GROUP BY` are both SQL operations that organize data into subsets for further analysis, but they serve different purposes and are used in different contexts. 

Here's an overview of the key differences:

### PARTITION BY

- **Context**: Used with window functions.
- **Purpose**: Divides the result set into partitions to which the window function is applied, but does not collapse these partitions into a single output row per partition. Instead, it keeps the original rows and adds a new column with the window function result for each row.
- **Functionality**: Enables you to perform calculations over a set of rows that are somehow related to the current row while still returning the full dataset. Common window functions include `ROW_NUMBER()`, `RANK()`, `SUM()`, `AVG()`, and more.
- **Result**: The original number of rows in the query result is maintained, with each row now including additional information calculated by the window function.

**Example Usage**:
Calculating the cumulative salary within each department without changing the number of rows in the output.
```sql
SELECT employee_id, department, salary,
       SUM(salary) OVER (PARTITION BY department ORDER BY salary) AS cumulative_salary
FROM employees;
```

### GROUP BY

- **Context**: Used in aggregation queries.
- **Purpose**: Groups rows that have the same values in specified columns into summary rows, like "find the total salary by department."
- **Functionality**: When you use `GROUP BY`, you must use an aggregate function (`SUM()`, `COUNT()`, `MAX()`, `MIN()`, `AVG()`, etc.) to reduce the rows in each group to a single summary row. You cannot select individual row details unless they are included in the GROUP BY clause or are used in an aggregate function.
- **Result**: The result set is a condensed version of the original dataset, usually with fewer rows, where each row represents a group.

**Example Usage**:
Calculating the total salary for each department, reducing the output to one row per department.
```sql
SELECT department, SUM(salary) AS total_salary
FROM employees
GROUP BY department;
```

### Key Differences

- **Aggregation vs. Windowing**: `GROUP BY` aggregates rows across the entire table and returns a single row per group, while `PARTITION BY` is used with window functions to perform calculations across rows that are somehow related to the current row within each partition, without collapsing these rows into a single row.
- **Output**: `GROUP BY` produces a summary result with fewer rows, whereas `PARTITION BY` maintains the original dataset's row count, enriching each row with additional calculations.

Understanding when to use `PARTITION BY` versus `GROUP BY` depends on whether you need to retain individual row details while performing calculations (`PARTITION BY`) or you need to summarize your data into fewer rows (`GROUP BY`).
